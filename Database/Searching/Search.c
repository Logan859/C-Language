/* SEARCHING:
 *
 * Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element 
 * from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation,
 * these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

 * 1) Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every 
 * element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

 * 2) Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted 
 * data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear 
 * Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search 
 * space in half. For Example: Binary Search.

/*
 * Given a sorted array of n uniformly distributed values arr[], 
 * write a function to search for a particular element x in the array. 
 * Linear Search finds the element in O(n) time, Jump Search takes O(âˆš n) time and Binary Search take O(Log n) time. 
 * The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are 
 * uniformly distributed. Binary Search always goes to the middle element to check. On the other hand, interpolation search
 * may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched. For example, if the value of the key is
 * closer to the last element, interpolation search is likely to start search toward the end side.
 *
 * If x is present in arr[0..n-1], then returns
 * index of it, else returns -1.
 *
 * The idea of formula is to return higher value of pos
 * when element to be searched is closer to arr[hi]. And
 * smaller value when closer to arr[lo]
 * pos = lo + [ (x-arr[lo])*(hi-lo) / (arr[hi]-arr[Lo]) ]
 *
 * arr[] ==> Array where elements need to be searched
 * x     ==> Element to be searched
 * lo    ==> Starting index in arr[]
 * hi    ==> Ending index in arr[]
